With `jones`, creating an experiment is as simple as putting your stimuli in a folder and tweaking the parameters in a few configuration files.

In this guide, we will detail the steps involved in creating a new experiment excitingly named `my_experiment`.

<Steps>

1. Create a directory called `my_experiment` in `data` with the follwing sub-directories in it:

    `assets/`

    `config/`

    `results/`

2. [Download](../../dataset.zip) the sample dataset and transfer to the `assets` folder.

3.  <div>
    Each stimulus file should have an accompanying text file with the same name (if the stimulus is `trial_1.png`, there should also be a `trial_1.txt`). The text file should contain the information about the stimulus that you want recorded in the results.
    
    For example: 

    ```txt title="trial_1.txt"
    id,condition,correct_response
    trial_1,face,yes
    ```

    :::note
    There should be no whitespace between the fields.
    :::

    </div>

4.  <div>
    In `config`, create a file called `settings.json` with the following fields:

    ```json title="settings.json"
    {
        "kind": "image",
        "nInterval": 1,
        "fileExtension": "png",
        "trialsPerBlock": 3,
        "blocksPerXp": 2,
        "addRepeatBlock": false,
        "allowCreate": true,
        "createPassword": "consent",
        "adminPassword": "temporary_to_change",
    }
    ```
    </div>

    **Reference: [settings.json](/reference/settings/)**

5. <div>
    Next, we will create a file called `wording.new.json` (in `config`) with the following fields:

    ```json title="wording.new.json"
    {
        "instructions": "Before starting the experiment, please fill in the follwing details:",
        "idLabel": "ParticipantID",
        "passwordLabel": "Password",
        "submitLabel": "Submit",
        "serverError": "Server error",
        "wrongPassword": "Incorrect password. Please contact the organizer of this study.",
        "invalidId": "Invalid Participant ID"
    }
    ```
    </div>

    These fields essentially define the text to display in the form that the participants need to submit before starting the experiment.

6. <div>
    Finally, we create a file called `wording.run.json` in which we declare the text to show in various situations during the experiment:

    ```json title="wording.run.json"
    {
        "title": "Faces vs. Houses",
        "collect": "Please enter the follwing information:",
        "collectButton": "Submit",
        "introduction": "If you see a face, press 'f' on your keyboard. But if you see a house, press 'h'.",
        "pause": "This is a break.",
        "pauseOver": "The break is over. You may resume the experiment.",
        "resume": "Resume the experiment",
        "end": "End the the experiment",
        "thanks": "Thank you for participating.",
        "closed": "The experiment has already been completed by this participant.",
        "connectionError": "Connection lost; please refresh the page.",
        "next": "to continue",
        "space": "space",
        "question": "Did you see a face in the image?",
        "keyAlt1": "f",
        "keyAlt2": "h",
        "labelAlt1": "Yes",
        "labelAlt2": "No",
        "codeAlt1": "yes",
        "codeAlt2": "no"
    }
    ```
    </div>

7.  <div>
    Run the experiment locally for testing:

    ```sh
    go run main.go -APP_MODE DEV
    ```

    It should be available on http://localhost:8100/xp/my_experiment/new
    </div>

8. When ready, the experiment can be built and deployed by following the steps outlined [here](/deploy)
