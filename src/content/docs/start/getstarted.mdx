import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download a suitable binary from here: https://go.dev/dl/

2. Clone the git repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/neuro-team-femto/jones.git
    ```

3. In the `jones` directory, you should have the directory `examples` containing several small test experiments to run and use as a guide to create your own.
    <FileTree>
    - config/
    - **examples/**
      - image_int1/
      - image_int2/
      - ...
    - front/
    - helpers/
    - public/
    - server/
    - xp/
    - dockerfile
    - go.mod
    - go.sum
    - main.go
    </FileTree>

    Create a folder called `data` in the root directory and copy one of the folders in `examples` into it.

4. From the root directory run the following commands to start in development mode:
    <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Command line argument">
        ```sh
        go run main.go -APP_MODE DEV
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Environment variable">
        ```sh
        APP_MODE=DEV go run main.go
        ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

5. The experiment should now be running on http://localhost:8100/xp/image_int1/new
